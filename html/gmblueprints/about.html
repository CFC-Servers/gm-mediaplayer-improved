			<h2>Warning</h2>
			<p>
				While this does work in multiplayer, I only recommend that you use it with people you trust.
				There is a user management system to mitigate some of the risks around this, but it hasn't been fully tested.<br/><br/>
				Players who use this <strong class="important">CAN EXECUTE CUSTOM SERVERSIDE SCRIPTS</strong>.

			<h1>Hey there!</h1>
			<h5>
				Thank you for downloading this addon and trying it out.
				It's a little rough around the edges right now, but it will be updated frequently.
				There are a lot of things I would have liked to fix before launch, but if I
				kept working on them, this would probably never be released.
