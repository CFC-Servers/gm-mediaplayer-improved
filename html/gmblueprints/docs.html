			<h1>Managing Files</h1>
			<p>This is the file manager, here you can upload / download modules, toggle which modules are currently running, and delete files.<br/>
			The left panel shows all the files you have locally on your machine.<br/>
			The right panel shows all files that have been uploaded to the server.<br/>
			Double-click on a local file to open it.
			</p>
			<img src="images/18_filemanager.png", alt="file-manager"/>
			<p>Right click a file to access options</p>
			<img src="images/19_filemenu.png", alt="file-manager-menu"/>
			<p>When a file is green, it means that the file is locked by you. Nobody else can edit that file on the server while you have it locked.<br/>
			When a file is red, it means that the file is locked by someone else and you cannot edit it.</p>
			<img src="images/20_filelocked.png", alt="file-manager-locked"/>

			<h1>Managing Users</h1>
			<p>This is the user manager, here you can assign permissions to users to control who can do what in the blueprint system.<br/>
			Simply check the box next to which role you want to assign to a user.<br/><br/>
			<b>Currently you can only assign a user between 4 pre-designed groups. Group creation / editing coming soon.</b><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Admin: </b>Can do anything.<br/>
			<b>Auditor: </b>Can toggle blueprints. (soon to be able to view any server blueprint in read-only mode).<br/>
			<b>Trusted: </b>Can upload blueprints to the server, can run blueprints locally, and can toggle which blueprints are running. They are also allowed to use protected nodes <br/>
			<b>Newbie: </b>Can only upload blueprints to the server. Their blueprint will not run until someone toggles it for them.<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
			By default, any new player who joins isn't a member of any of these groups, and cannot do anything with blueprints.<br/>
			Group / user information is stored persistently on the server.
